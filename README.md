# :closed_lock_with_key: Bitcoin Testnet HD Wallet Generator

This project generates a Bitcoin wallet on the **Testnet** network using Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) derivation and a mnemonic seed phrase. It leverages the `bip32`, `bip39`, and `bitcoinjs-lib` libraries to create a wallet with a public address and private key.

## Features
- Generates a 12-word mnemonic (seed phrase) for wallet recovery.
- Creates an HD wallet using the Testnet network.
- Derives the first account's public address and private key from the seed.
- Outputs the Bitcoin Testnet address, private key (in WIF format), and the mnemonic seed.
-

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)
